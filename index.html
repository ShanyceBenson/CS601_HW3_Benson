            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, Iâ€™m Shanyce a web developer with a creative spirit, a
              structured mind, and a love for all things purple. Iâ€™m currently
              living in South Korea as a proud military spouse (my husbandâ€™s a
              Blackhawk pilot!), building my career remotely while soaking in
              new experiences and perspectives. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll
              probably find me out for a walk or bike ride, controller in hand
              playing Marvel Rivals, or tuned in to my favorite shows Tracker,
              Will Trent, The Rookie, 911, and Found. I watch them faithfully
              each week, and yes, I will cancel plans to avoid spoilers.
            </p>
            <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                My favorite color is purple, it's not just a preference, itâ€™s a
                whole vibe.
              </li>
              <li>Iâ€™m a strategist at heart, both in games and in life.</li>
              <li>
                I play Marvel Rivals the most right now, but I also love Dead by
                Daylight and Call of Duty.
              </li>
              <li>
                Walking and biking are my go-to resets after long coding
                sessions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Iâ€™m totally that person who schedules life around TV nights. I
                never miss an episode of Tracker, Will Trent, The Rookie, 911,
                or Found.
              </li>
              <li>
                I thrive in structured chaos: give me a challenge, and Iâ€™ll turn
                it into a checklist.
              </li>

              <h2>Validation Form</h2>
              <p>
                This project is a simple subscription form that collects a
                user's first name, last name, email, package selection, and
                subscription confirmation. It includes client-side validation
                using JavaScript to ensure proper input formats and required
                field completion, excluding the optional email field. If all
                inputs are valid, a personalized summary message is displayed,
                and the form is hidden using DOM manipulation. The form's
                validation logic uses regular expressions and the forEach()
                high-order function for cleaner, modular code.

              <h2>Drag and Drop Game</h2>
              <p>
                This project is a simple web-based drag-and-drop game where
                users categorize a list of movies and sitcoms. The data is
                loaded dynamically from a package.json file and randomly
                shuffled each time the page loads. Users drag each item into the
                appropriate drop zone based on its category. The application is
                built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and demonstrates event
                handling, DOM manipulation, and basic interactive UI design.

              <h2>MyPortfolio</h2>
              <p>
                This project is a responsive one-page portfolio built using only
                HTML5 and CSS, styled in a custom dark mode theme. It includes a
                header and footer designed with Flexbox for proper alignment, a
                CSS Grid-based project gallery, and a sidebar with personal
                information. Interactivity is added through pseudo-classes like
                :hover, :focus, and :nth-child(n), and enhanced visuals are
                created using a ::before pseudo-element. The layout also
                demonstrates advanced CSS skills like combinators, attribute
                selectors, and ensures the footer stays at the bottom of the
                page regardless of content height.

              <p>
                This project is a dark-themed, responsive personal portfolio
                website built using React, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It
                features a drag-and-drop game to showcase interactivity, a
                visually styled resume timeline, and a working contact form
                powered by Formspree. The layout is fully mobile-friendly with
                adaptive design elements and modern animations for a polished
                user experience. The site serves as both a personal introduction
                and a professional showcase for web development skills.
